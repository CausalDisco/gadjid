Description: Make efficient Rust implementations of graph adjustment
    identification distances available in R. These distances (based on ancestor,
    optimal, and parent adjustment) count how often the respective adjustment
    identification strategy leads to causal inferences that are incorrect
    relative to a ground-truth graph when applied to a candidate graph instead.
